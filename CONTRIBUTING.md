# Contributing

If you want to contribute to the bower website, [fill out the support declaration](http://goo.gl/forms/P1ndzCNoiG) to gain access to the repository. Alternatively, you can just fork the repository and submit pull requests. There are a two things you can do:

* [Write documentation](https://github.com/bower/bower.github.io/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#writingdocumentation)
* [Improve the website design](https://github.com/bower/bower.github.io/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#improvingthewebsitedesign)

## Writing Documentation

When writing documentation, please remember:
> Less talk, More examples

Like this:

```
## The `blah` command line tool:

`Blah` can be installed through NPM:

  $ npm install blah
  
Install NPM through brew:

  $ brew install node
  
Install brew by visiting http://brew.sh or by running:

  $ brew install brew
```

When you write, try to include an example for each paragraph.

## Improving the Website Design

When improving the design, keep this in mind:

* Keep the page simple
* Don't add too many pictures (it makes the place look ugly)
* Stick with the [bower color palette](https://github.com/bower/bower.github.io/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#bowercolorpalette)
* It's a good idea to follow the [commit rules](https://github.com/bower/bower.github.io/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commitrules)

## Bower Color Palette

These are the same colors used in the [bower bird](http://bower.io/img/bower-logo.png):
