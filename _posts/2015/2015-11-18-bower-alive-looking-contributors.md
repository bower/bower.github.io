Hello world!

Bower turned three years old last September. That may make Bower old in JavaScript terms, but Bower is still kicking. 2015 has seen [9 releases](https://github.com/bower/bower/releases) already, included two minor releases, with v1.6 releases shipping last month. [Looking at the stats](http://bower.io/stats/), Bower usage continues to grow. Bower is more popular now than ever. That's why we're stepping up.

I'll be real: We have not done a good job of managing the project. Ever since its release, Bower's management has always been one of its pain-points. There is an ideal that a great open-source project will create a healthy community around it. I've come to learn it's the other way around. In order to best support Bower, we need to foster its community. We want to fix this.

**We are looking for contributors. Bower can use your help:**

+ Fixing bugs and vulnerabilities
+ Replying to issues on GitHub
+ Writing documentation
+ Developing new features
+ Championing a product vision and roadmap

By contributing to Bower, you are working on a high-visibility project with tremendous usage. `npm install bower` happens 100,000 times a day. [Adam has launched a crowdfunding campaign](https://salt.bountysource.com/teams/bower) to provide monetary rewards for contributors. (I'll also throw in a [legit t-shirt](https://cottonbureau.com/products/bower) and some stickers to sweeten the deal.)

Throw your hat in the ring by [filling out this form](http://goo.gl/forms/P1ndzCNoiG), or just jump right in and get your [hands dirty on some fresh issues](https://github.com/bower/bower/issues).

Bower is made by people. It's not just a bird logo. We realize we need to bring people together to keep Bower going. Help make that happen.
